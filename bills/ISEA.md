### Section 102: Definitions
For the purposes of this Act:

  2. Threatening or implementing funding cuts in response to unwanted findings
  3. Preventing publication of research for non-scientific reasons
  4. Appointing unqualified individuals to scientific positions based on political loyalty
  Documentation of any of the above actions creates a rebuttable presumption of interference.
